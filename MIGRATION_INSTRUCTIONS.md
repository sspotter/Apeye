# 🚀 Resource Library - Migration Instructions

## Quick Setup

Since you don't have Supabase CLI configured, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard** at https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of this file: `supabase/migrations/20251010000000_create_resources_schema.sql`
6. Paste it into the SQL Editor
7. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

You should see a success message indicating the tables were created!

### Step 2: Verify the Tables

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Table Editor**
2. You should now see two new tables:
   - `resource_categories`
   - `resources`

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. Start your development server if not already running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Navigate to the **Tester** page in your app
3. Create your first category and add resources!

## What Was Changed?

### ✅ Database Schema
- Created `resource_categories` table for organizing resources
- Created `resources` table for storing website links
- Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Set up automatic timestamps and cascade deletes

### ✅ Component Updates
- **Supabase Integration**: Data now persists to database instead of localStorage
- **Tab-Based Layout**: Categories appear as tabs in a sidebar (not full-width accordions)
- **Better UX**: Larger, more readable resource cards when viewing
- **Delete Categories**: Can now delete categories with confirmation
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data exists

## Features

- 📁 **Category Management**: Create, view, and delete categories
- 🔗 **Resource Organization**: Add, edit, and delete resources
- 🔍 **Search**: Filter resources within each category
- 🎨 **Theme Support**: Works with light, dark, and emerald themes
- 🔒 **Secure**: Row-level security ensures users only see their own data
- 💾 **Auto-save**: All changes persist to Supabase automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project
- Check that your database has the `auth.users` table (should exist by default)

### Can't See Data
- Verify you're logged in with the same account
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Ensure RLS policies were created correctly
